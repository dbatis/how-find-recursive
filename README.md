# how-find-recursive

This is just a handly little tool for when, occasionally, I have to search
for specific files in a directory tree and perform some action, so that it
can be used as a reference instead of searching Stack Overflow each time.
If it helps someone else as well, all the better.

It supports command-line search and actions for Linux, Windows Powershell
and MacOS. Whenever possible, the resulting commands do not require
the installation of external tools, however there are certain cases
(such as moving files to the trash bin) where the only option is to install
a third-party tool.

You can use this tool online at
